	* Version 0.8

	This is the first official release of pmemkv project.

	It unifies and extends native C and C++ API and introduces config
	structure - flexible way for configuring engines.

	Pmemkv core was redesigned - C++ API is now implemented on top of C API
	and exposed as a header-only library.

	We have also provided users with extended pmemkv engines and API
	documentation - man pages were created.

	Changes in tests and build system:
	- added travis CI
	- cmake creation and build system refactor
	- added tests with pmemcheck/memcheck/helgrind/drd
	- added clang-format
	- added coverity support
	- added coverage support
	- added CI jobs for checking compability with bindings: Ruby, Java, Node.js

	Optimizations:
	- string_view class for optimized keys passing
	- heterogeneous lookup in cmap engine

	Features:
	- added error messages
	- extended error handling

	We have also modified existing engines and tests to meet changes in both
	pmemkv core and API. Some function names was cleaned up which, in
	retrospect, were chosen poorly.

	The reason this release has version 0.8 is because we are still open for
	suggestions from customers before we stabilize the APIs and commit
	to maintaining backward compatibility. It does not mean that the library
	is unfinished or unstable. However, more engines and exteded
	functonality are being palnned to deliver in the future.
