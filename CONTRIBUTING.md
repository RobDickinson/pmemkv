Submitting Pull Requests
------------------------

We take outside code contributions to `pmemkv` through GitHub pull requests.

Creating New Engines
--------------------

There are several motivations to create a `pmemkv` storage engine:

* Using a new/different implementation strategy
* Trying out a significant change to an existing engine
* Creating a new version of an existing engine with some tweaks

Next we'll walk you through the steps of creating a new engine.

### Picking Engine Name

* Relatively short (users will have to type this!)
* Formatted in all lower-case
* No whitespace or special characters
* Names should use common prefixes to denote capabilities:
  - prefix of "v" denotes volatile (persistent if omitted), appears first
  - prefix of "c" denotes concurrent (single-threaded if omitted), appears second
  - prefix of "s" denotes sorted (unsorted if omitted), appears last
* For this example: `mytree` (persistent, single-threaded, unsorted)

### Creating Engine Header

* Create `src/engines/mytree.h` header file
* For new engines, use `blackhole.h` as a template
* Use `pmemkv::mytree` namespace to define internal types
* Define `ENGINE` constant in namespace to export engine name
* Use camel-case for implementation class name (`class MyTree`)

### Creating Engine Implementation

* Create `src/engines/mytree.cc` implementation file
* For new engines, use `blackhole.cc` as a template
* Use `pmemkv::mytree` namespace defined by the header

### Providing Unit Test

* Create `tests/engines/mytree_test.cc` for unit tests
* For new engines, use `blackhole_test.cc` as a template
* For stable engines, just copy existing tests (eventually replace the original)

### Updating Build System

* In `CMakeLists.txt`:
    * Add `src/engines/mytree.h` and `src/engines/mytree.cc` to `SOURCE_FILES`
    * Add `tests/engines/mytree_test.cc` to `pmemkv_test` executable
    * Use `pkg_check_modules` and/or `find_package` for upstream libraries
* `make` should now run to completion without errors

### Updating KVEngine

* In `src/pmemkv.cc`:
    * Add `#include "engines/mytree.h"`
    * Update `KVEngine::Start` to return new `MyTree` instances
    * Update `KVEngine::Stop` to delete `MyTree` instances
* `make` & verify engine now works with high-level bindings

### Documentation

* In `ENGINES.md`, add `mytree` section
* In `README.md`, link `mytree` in the table of supported engines

Creating Experimental Engines
-----------------------------

The instructions above describe creating an engine that is included in the `pmemkv` build by default.
There is also the option of creating experimental engines that are not ready to include by default.
These include engines that are still being actively developed, optimized, reviewed or documented.

Experimental engines are unsupported prototypes, but are still expected to have proper automated tests,
and for all defined tests to pass.

### Experimental Code

Use the `EXPERIMENTAL` conditional define to exclude code from the default build.

```
#ifdef EXPERIMENTAL
...
#endif
```

### Experimental Build Assets

Extend this existing section in `CMakeLists.txt` if your experimental engine requires libraries that
are not yet included in the default build.

```
if(EXPERIMENTAL)
    include(foo-experimental)
endif(EXPERIMENTAL)
```

As noted in the example above, the experimental CMake module should use `-experimental` in the file name.
